# Changelog

## v0.1.0

### It works! See changelog for details. - 2024-02-18
All the source code is now under the src/ directory. Configure script is introduced so you can compile the project in a separate build directory.
Some compilation options can be set in config.mk file. Now vec_t is used for handling allocation instead of alloc function.
